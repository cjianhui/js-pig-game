## Game Rules:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls 2 dices as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points (or a preset score) on GLOBAL score wins the game
